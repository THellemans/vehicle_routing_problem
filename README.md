# Implementation for the vehicle routing problem

Implementation of an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search algorithm to optimize a vehicle routing problem.
This code was written to obtain the maximal score for the last assignment of the [discrete optimization course]{https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-optimization}.

## Motivation

Discrete optimization is everywhere! The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a well known optimization problem which (attempts) to answer the question:

> What is the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to traverse in order to deliver to a given set of customers?

Variations of this question are interesting in many practical applications.

## Running the code

In order to test the code, run `python solver_ALNS.py ./data/vrp_5_4_1` or any other file in the data folder.

## The algorithm

We give an in depth overview of the implemented algorithm at my [github page](https://thellemans.github.io/Portfolio-Tim-Hellemans/).
